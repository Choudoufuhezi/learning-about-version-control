# Learning about Version Control

Author: Hanlin(Hank) Zhao

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

One thing that I really like about version control is that, when it comes to projects that require collaboration between group members and editing/ensuring correctness of the project, using version control can be really helpful to prevent loss of information and strengthen the transparency of the project. In this way, everyone knows what they should be doing and who is responsible.

One thing that I find really challenging about version control is that I struggle to fully verbalize the concept to my group mates when working on a group project. In other words, I know how to use version control, but I find it difficult to explain it in a way that others can understand. Therefore, when working with group members who aren't familiar with version control, I have to spend a lot of time explaining how it works, which can be extremely challenging from my perspective.
